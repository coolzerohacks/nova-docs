**Nova Daily Build Log: 30 May 2025**

---

### ✅ Achievements

**🔧 System Recovery and Docker Fixes**

* Built and validated new `nova-base` container with GPU support (Python 3.11 + Torch).
* Verified `torch.cuda.is_available()` inside container returns `True`.
* Updated Docker and NVIDIA runtime settings; fixed Compose GPU flags.
* Removed legacy whisper container and deployed `rhasspy/wyoming-whisper`.
* Resolved port 10300 exposure and runtime compatibility.
* Aligned all services on `nova-setup` Docker network.

**📅 Calendar & To-Do Flow Enhancements**

* Fixed calendar service call bug (`create_event` → `add_event`).
* Improved date/time parsing with `dateparser` fallback.
* Enhanced intent training and response flow for to-do entries.
* Verified updates to `calendar.nova` and `todo.nova_tasks`.

**🔧 Wake Word Prep**

* Recorded 39 ".wav" samples for "Hey Nova" wake word.
* Built Python 3.10 venv and installed `microwakeword` from source.
* Resolved build errors (e.g., missing `python3.10-dev`).
* Ready to extract features and train custom model.

**📈 Devshell Enhancements**

* Logging now includes `[DEBUG]`, `[WARN]`, `[FALLBACK]` markers.
* Fixed `nova_assistant` being disabled in HA config.
* Integrated fallback calendar parsing into devshell pipeline.

### 📅 Action Items for 31 May

**🎤 Wake Word Integration**

* Extract features from sample WAVs and train model.
* Replace existing wake model in ESPHome Voice.
* Validate end-to-end wake detection and trigger flow.

**🔊 Conversational Experience**

* Implement follow-up context window for chained replies.
* Add `introduce_person(name)` with randomized greetings.

**📊 GPU Monitoring**

* Confirm GPU utilization on whisper inference.
* Reduce fallback to `float32` via container tuning.

**🌍 HA Calendar Review**

* Ensure Local Calendar integration is active post-rebuild.
* Confirm consistent behavior from `calendar.add_event`.

### 🗃️ Git Hygiene & Container Notes

**📂 Changes**

* `.gitignore` updated to exclude:

  * `piper-data/`
  * `faster-whisper-config/`
  * `home-assistant-voice-pe/`

* Avoided tracking embedded `.git` from ESPHome repo.

* Used `git rm --cached` and forced push after cleanup.

**🚶 Future Containers**

* Build from nova-base if CUDA/Python stack is needed.
* Always align network in Compose (`nova-setup`).
* Document and exclude large models from Git.
