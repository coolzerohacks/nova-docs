🔧 System & Code Adjustments

    Corrected KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAP and CATEGORY_MAP:
    Removed obsolete entries like "politics_query": "politics" to prevent routing errors.

    Deleted politics collection from ChromaDB:
    Manually cleared all memories from politics before deleting the collection to keep categories consistent.

    Verified and corrected collection routing:
    Ensured that subcategories like “BBC Politics” route into the news collection and not a defunct politics one.

🧠 Memory System Debugging

    Tracked a bug where F1 data was not retrieved:
    Diagnosed that data added via the f1_ingest.py script wasn’t being surfaced in main queries due to a mismatch in category mapping.

    Tested memory access via direct ChromaDB query script:
    Confirmed that embedded entries (e.g., Oscar Piastri’s status) were accessible and correctly stored.

    Adjusted similarity threshold and category filters in select_memory_by_intent to match test script results.

⚙️ Ingestion & Embedding

    Ran f1_ingest.py successfully:
    Embedded 65 fresh entries into f1_news from f1_2025.json.
    Confirmed success in query after threshold tuning.

    Validated technology memory retrieval:
    Verified that technology_query intent pulled fresh RSS entries as expected.

📝 Fact Insertion via Chat

    Reconfirmed Nova’s text-to-fact syntax:
    Use here is some <category> info: (e.g., here is some <f1_news> info:) to save facts directly from chat into text files under raw/.

🔐 Permissions

    Restored default permissions for mounted knowledge/ directory inside containers:

sudo chmod -R 775 knowledge/
sudo chown -R $USER:docker knowledge/

Ensures Nova can read/write facts correctly.
