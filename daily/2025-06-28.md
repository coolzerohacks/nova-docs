## 🌍 Live Web Search Enhancements

1. **Search Processing Refactored**  
   - Moved summarisation and formatting logic from chat_routes.py into perform_live_search() within nova_live_search.py  
   - Now returns a structured object:
     ```python
     {
       "summary": "<concatenated fact summaries>",
       "sources_text": "**Sources:**\n- Title — [Link](URL)\n…",
       "intro_line": "According to ..."
     }
     ```

2. **Source Attribution Added**  
   - Extracts site names via get_source_name(item['url']), and lists them in the intro line  
   - Example:  
     _I checked Met Office, BBC and Netweather and here's what I found..._

3. **Prevention of Redundant Prefixes**  
   - Chat route logic updated to conditionally add "🌍 " only if not already present  
   - Ensures consistent, friendly presentation without duplication

## 🧠 Knowledge‑Base (Memory) Refinements

1. **Single Memory Call**  
   - Removed all duplicate invocations of query_knowledge_base() from chat_routes.py  
   - Now fully managed by select_memory_by_intent() in intent_utils.py

2. **Structured Memory Response**  
   - query_knowledge_base() now returns a dict:
     ```python
     {
       "summary": "concatenated top facts",
       "sources_text": "**Memory Recall:**\n- (0.79) Fact1\n…",
       "intro_line": "Based on what you've taught me, here's what I remember:"
     }
     ```

3. **Avoid Double Brain Emojis**  
   - Chat route now adds "🧠" only if the content does not already start with it

4. **Fixed Edge Cases in .strip() Logic**  
   - Enhanced runtime checks to safely call .strip() without risking errors

## 💬 Response Guards and Style Refinements

1. **Pet Name Filtering Enhanced**  
   - filter_pet_names() blocks forbidden terms like “love”, “sweetheart”, etc.  
   - Now applies _before_ responses are added to memory.

2. **New Social Term Filter**  
   - filter_social_terms() suppresses terms like “my friend”, “buddy”, etc.  
   - Prevents tone slippage into generic friendliness.

3. **Integrated in Response Pipeline**  
   - Filters now applied in correct order _before_ memory addition:
     - greeting guard
     - prefix guard
     - pet name filter
     - social term filter

4. **Behavior Rule Updated**  
   - System prompt now includes:
     - “Never use generic social terms like 'my friend'...”
     - Greeting limit changed to once per 24 hours.

## 🛠️ What We've Improved Together

| Area             | What's Better Now                                                  |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Live Search**  | Cleaner summaries, clear source listing, user-friendly intros      |
| **Memory Flow**  | Centralised in one place, no more duplicates, structured output    |
| **Prefix Handling** | Consistent emojis with no doubles                                 |
| **Guard Filtering** | Pet names and social terms cleaned _before_ memory saves         |
| **System Prompt** | Stronger rule enforcement, fewer robotic or generic phrases       |
| **Error Safety** | Resilient .strip() logic that avoids NoneType errors               |

## 🔍 Next Focus Areas

### 🔁 Repetition Handling
- Investigate how Nova repeats facts across multiple turns.
- Examine chat_memory for how previous user and bot turns are stored.
- Evaluate repeat guard formatting injected into system prompts.
- Tune memory windowing and last line comparisons to better suppress factual re-statements.

### 🧪 Example of the issue
Nova repeated similar info:
- “🧠🧠 I remember that Oscar Piastri...” multiple times with slight rephrasing.
- Need to reduce factual repetition without harming friendly tone.
