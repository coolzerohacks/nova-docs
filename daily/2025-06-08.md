üóìÔ∏è Nova ‚Äì Today‚Äôs Development Summary (2025‚Äë06‚Äë08)
1. Cleaned Up Code & Files

    Deleted 110+ outdated images cluttering the disk.

    Removed the obsolete nova-brain directory.

    Purged old Zigbee logs, Rasa caches, and redundant files across the system.

2. Revamped Knowledge Base Structure

    Created multiple topic-specific knowledge bases under tools/uploaders/, each with its own YAML uploader:

        f1, ctf, tv, news (with politics), technology, hacking, coding, nova_build, diary, user_fact.

    Updated CATEGORY_MAP and KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAP in app.py to align with intent structured naming (*_query):

    CATEGORY_MAP = {
        "f1_query": ["f1", ‚Ä¶],
        ‚Ä¶,
        "nova_build_query": ["nova_build"],
        ‚Ä¶
    }
    KNOWLEDGE_BASE_MAP = {
        "nova_build_query": "nova_build",
        ‚Ä¶
    }

3. Enabled Natural-Language Injection

    Configured Nova to accept messages like:

    Here is some <tv> info ‚Äî please add it to your <tv> knowledge base:
    <Content>

    Nova saves content to tv_yaml_uploader.py, which formats and stores it to knowledge/tv/‚Ä¶.

4. ChromaDB Reset & Reconstruction

    Triggered readonly database issues when .chroma was deleted.

    Re-created ./chroma/ inside ~/nova-setup, corrected ownership and permissions.

    Restarted chromadb container with proper volume binding (./chroma:/chroma).

    Rebuilt memory by running RSS ingest, diary generation, and YAML uploaders.

5. Refined Cron Jobs

    Centralized all cron jobs under /tools/uploaders/.

    Verified scheduling accuracy:

        02:00 daily ‚Äî All YAML uploaders

        03:30‚Äì03:35 UTC ‚Äî Git auto-sync and docs sync

        03:00 weekly ‚Äî Old-log purge

        06:00 daily ‚Äî News RSS ingest

        06:10 daily ‚Äî Compress memory

        23:00 daily ‚Äî Diary generation

        02:30 Sunday ‚Äî Full backup

        04:00 Monday ‚Äî F1 sync & ingest

        Every minute ‚Äî GPU heartbeat

    Updated cron_jobs_checklist.md to reflect correct tool paths.

6. Investigated Voicebox Memory Bug

    Audited app.py to prevent raw voice transcripts from being written to memory.

    Inserted logging-only code, preventing hard memory dumps.

7. Refined Documentation

    Wrote natural_memory_injection.md describing how to inject knowledge via natural language.

    Created recover_chroma.md with step-by-step recovery instructions.

    Commited intentions to move daily logs into nova-docs/daily/.

‚úÖ What‚Äôs Next

    Save this log as nova-docs/daily/2025-06-08.md.

    Diagnose the "Unknown category: nova_build" error by tracing intent tags and YAML parser behavior.

    Refactor voice transcript handling for consistent memory injection.
