**🗓️ Nova Development Report — Sunday, 21June 2025**

---

### ✅ Completed Today

**🔍 System Prompt and Logging**

* Verified system prompt is correctly injected into messages.
* Added `IS_DEV` toggle for debug logging.
* Restored clean logging with clear Mistral replies.
* Added tone enforcement to check use of pet names.

**🛠️ Docker Rebuild Flow**

* Fixed `docker compose` rebuild issue by switching from `--build` to `--force-recreate`.
* Confirmed rebuild behavior correctly applies code changes.

**🎙️ Voice Output and Intent Handling**

* Resolved Home Assistant intent\_script bug that blocked speech output.
* Reverted to working template:

```yaml
intent_script:
  NovaChat:
    action:
      - service: shell_command.nova_chat
        data:
          message: "{{ message }}"
      - delay: "00:00:02"
    speech:
      text: "{{ states('input_text.nova_response') }}"
```

* Sanitized emoji and long replies for safe display and TTS.
* Rejected unauthorized intimate terms unless user initiated.

**📆 Calendar Integration**

* Fixed critical `UnboundLocalError` due to bad import handling.
* Refactored `extract_event_details()` in `utils.py`:

  * Added regex fallback for structured time strings.
  * Improved summary detection.
* Verified successful creation of events with correct timing.

**📁 Git History Restoration**

* Used Git rollback to retrieve the 30 May version of a file.
* Ensured clean baseline for updated development.
* Reinforces importance of structured commits and consistent pushes.

**🛰️ Zigbee2MQTT Setup and Debugging**

* Connected Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 Dongle Plus to Elysium host.
* Initially attempted Zigbee2MQTT container but ran into serial access issues.
* Transitioned to native Home Assistant ZHA integration.
* Successfully paired Zigbee light (“Office Light”) via ZHA.

**💡 Voice-Controlled Light Integration**

* Added and tested `turn_on` and `turn_off` intents with Rasa and Nova.
* Commands now correctly control Zigbee lights via Home Assistant.

**🔔 Reminder System (Draft 1)**

* Initial implementation of voice-triggered reminders.
* Used Rasa intent → delay thread in Nova → HA script call.
* Used `calendar.create_event` with fallback 30-min duration.
* HA automation added to announce events with TTS.
* User feedback: too heavy — preference for lightweight notifications.

**📣 Voice Announcements via Piper**

* Set up media playback via `media_player.play_media` and TTS via `tts.piper`.
* Uploaded and verified chime sound.
* TTS works manually but not consistently from Nova.

**🛠 Reminder Debug Log**

* YAML script created for reminders with delay and message.
* Python handles delay via thread, then triggers HA script.
* Sound fails to play from Nova execution path.
* Delay and summary parsing works; logging added.
* Errors include timeouts and occasional 401 Unauthorized from HA.

### ✅ Updated Tasks for Monday, 3 June 2025

**🔁 Reminder System Revamp**

* Implement non-calendar-based reminders using:

  * `notify.*` or `media_player.play_media` for chime + TTS.
* Resolve why HA script works manually but fails from Nova call.

**📣 Debug Audio Chain in HA**

* Investigate TTS and media\_player timing issues.
* Confirm TTS fires with correct sound and speech.

**🧠 Tone, Logging, and Stability Refinement**

* Finalize logging output.
* Add fallback response when HA fails.

**📆 Calendar Events**

* Continue verifying long-form events with start and end times.
* Ensure graceful failure handling when times are unclear.

**🔌 Zigbee Expansion**

* Test additional Zigbee devices.
* Confirm new entities automatically appear in HA.

**🧪 Intent Testing**

* Expand Rasa intents for event creation, reminder variations, and light control.
* Include tests for timing ("in 10 minutes", "tomorrow 3pm") and context clues.
