🧠 Nova Development Summary – 4th June 2025
1. 📝 Diary Generation Enhancements

    Compressed Fact Summaries: Integrated a secondary summarization step in generate_diary.py to extract concise factual events from daily conversations. These are stored in ChromaDB with the type compressed_fact.

    ChromaDB Integration: Both the narrative diary and the compressed facts are now embedded and stored in ChromaDB for improved retrieval.

2. 🧠 Memory Retrieval Improvements

    Enhanced Filtering: Updated get_tagged_memories to apply type_filter="compressed_fact" for categories like diary, summary, user_fact, and f1_update. This ensures retrieval of the most relevant compressed memories.

    Logging: Maintained detailed logging throughout the memory retrieval process to aid in debugging and transparency.

3. 🗂️ Memory Compression Strategy

    Discussion on Compression: Decided that while f1_ingest would benefit from compressed summaries, RSS feeds might not be suitable for such processing.

    Script Planning: Initiated plans for a compress_memory_facts.py script to handle compression of relevant memory entries.

4. 🕒 Cron Job Scheduling

    Existing Jobs:

        RSS feed ingestion at 6:00 AM daily.

        Diary summary generation at 11:00 PM daily.

        Log cleanup at 3:00 AM every Sunday.

    Planned Additions:

        Schedule the compress_memory_facts.py script to run after RSS ingestion, ensuring timely compression of new entries.

5. 🐞 Bug Fixes & Adjustments

    Voice Input Handling: Addressed an UnboundLocalError in chat_mistral by ensuring the confidence variable is properly initialized.

    Input Filtering: Modified the threshold for discarding short, low-confidence inputs from 10 words to 5 words to reduce unnecessary processing
