📘 Daily Update – July 29, 2025
🧠 Context

Performed diagnostic, repair, and optimization work on your home-built Nova AI system, focusing on GPU compatibility, Docker container reliability, and system hygiene after a host update caused failures in key services (devshell, ollama, etc.).
✅ Summary of Work Done
🔧 1. Issue Diagnosis: NVIDIA Runtime Failure

    Identified failure cause:

    nvidia-container-cli: initialization error: nvml error: driver/library version mismatch

    Confirmed driver mismatch via nvidia-smi and modinfo:
    Host was running NVIDIA driver 575.57.08, but the loaded kernel module was compiled for an older kernel (6.8.0-64) while system was running 6.8.0-71.

🛠️ 2. Fix: NVIDIA Driver + Kernel Module Alignment

    Regenerated initramfs: sudo update-initramfs -u

    Recompiled driver for correct kernel: sudo dpkg-reconfigure nvidia-dkms-575

    Rebooted to load proper kernel + NVIDIA stack

    Verified:

        nvidia-smi worked

        CUDA visible inside Docker: ✅

🧱 3. Rebuilt Docker Image Infrastructure

    Rebuilt Dockerfile.base to support:

        CUDA 12.1.1 + cuDNN 8

        Python 3.11.8 (compiled from source)

        SQLite 3.43 (compiled from source)

        Pinned PyTorch + TorchVision + Torchaudio for CUDA 12.1

        faster-whisper and Hugging Face model pre-cache

        Optional: Ollama install + CUDA test inside container

    Built fresh with:

    docker build --no-cache -f nova-devshell/Dockerfile.base -t nova-base .
    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up -d

🐳 4. Validated docker-compose.yml

    Confirmed:

        All GPU containers (ollama, devshell, wyoming-*) properly configured with gpus: all and NVIDIA environment

        All services rebuilt cleanly using nova-base

🧼 5. System Cleanup

    Performed system-wide cleanup after rebuild:

    docker system prune -a --volumes
    docker builder prune --all

    Final disk usage (post-cleanup):

        Images: 13 active / 28GB

        Volumes: 6 (4 active)

        Containers: 13 running

🛡️ 6. Backup & Rollback Protection

Before cleanup:

    ✅ Full system backup taken

    ✅ Snapshots of all containers

    ✅ Git push for all Dockerfiles, configs, and Nova source code

🟢 System Status (Post-Operations)
Component	Status
NVIDIA Drivers	✅ 575.57.08 (kernel 6.8.0-71)
Docker GPU	✅ CUDA 12.9 detected
Ollama	✅ Running
devshell	✅ Rebuilt and GPU-active
whisper / piper	✅ Healthy
System Cleanup	✅ Complete
Backups	✅ Safe and versioned
📍 Next Steps (Optional)

    Set up weekly cleanup via cron (optional)

    Add GPU inference health checks to containers

    Add auto-rebuild + backup hooks for future updates
