# 🗓️ Nova – Daily Development Summary (2025‑06‑10)

## ✅ Completed

### 🔧 System Fixes and Recovery
- Resolved embedding dimension mismatch in `tv_shows` by fully regenerating the collection.
- YAML uploader now deletes stale/partial files after successful ingestion.
- Embedder `multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1` confirmed as consistent across usage.
- Main memory collection re-linked to `nova-memory` using correct Chroma persist path.

### 💾 Memory + File System
- Resolved `[Errno 13] Permission denied: 'chat_memory.json'` by correcting ownership:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./chroma ./nova-memory
  find . -type f -name "*.json" -exec sudo chown 1000:1000 {} \;

    chat_memory.json now saving correctly.

    Startup optimization noted from SentenceTransformer caching.

🧠 Knowledge Base Integrity

    Verified Chroma collections match folder layout under ./knowledge/.

    Removed obsolete collections: politics, coding_knowledge, hacking_knowledge.

    Validated active collections: coding, ctf, diary, f1_news, hacking, news, nova_build, technology, tv_shows, user_facts, and nova-memory.

🤖 Soft Override Logic

    Fallback override confirmed for low-confidence queries like F1 or pet-related inputs.

    Issue noted where override failed on term "Bolt" — likely a Rasa misclassification.

🧼 Codebase Cleanliness

    Searched codebase for deprecated collection usage — none found in active modules.

    Recommend deletion of legacy variants like appOLD.py, app25.py.

🔐 Permissions & Execution

    Made txt_to_yaml.py and yaml_uploader.py executable for cron compatibility.

    Recursively reset ownership:

    sudo chown -R coolzerohacks:coolzerohacks /home/coolzerohacks/nova-setup

    ⚠️ Warning: This may affect Docker-run services like Rasa if owned files were expected by root.

📝 Remaining Tasks

    Fine-tune fallback logic for partial/ambiguous intent queries.

    Archive unused legacy scripts.

    Automate collection health checks.

    Revisit fallback memory triggers once stability is confirmed.
