✅ Nova DevShell – Session Summary (27 July 2025)
🔧 Changes and Features Implemented
1️⃣ Backend: utility_routes.py

    File Upload Endpoint (/upload)

        Accepts a file.

        Saves file to UPLOAD_FOLDER.

        Chunks and ingests content into the knowledge base (save_raw_snippet).

        Summarizes content using mistral model via Ollama.

    Pasted Text Endpoint (/upload_text)

        Accepts JSON with { text, category }.

        Saves raw snippet.

        Calls ingest_snippet_to_kb to store YAML for knowledge base.

        Returns a success message.

    Categories List Endpoint (/categories)

        Returns all valid categories from COLLECTION_NAMES.

    Other Endpoints

        /clear_memory – clears memory for the user.

        /list_uploads – lists all uploaded files in the upload directory.

        /download/<filename> – allows downloading any uploaded file.

        /debug – checks connectivity to Ollama service.

2️⃣ Frontend: App.jsx

    Added Dynamic Category Dropdown

        Fetches /categories on mount.

        Populates a <select> with category options.

        Updates category state on change.

const [categories, setCategories] = useState([]);
const [category, setCategory] = useState("hacking");

useEffect(() => {
  const fetchCategories = async () => {
    try {
      const res = await fetch(${DEVSERVER_API}/categories);
      const data = await res.json();
      if (data.categories) setCategories(data.categories);
    } catch (err) {
      console.error("Failed to fetch categories", err);
    }
  };
  fetchCategories();
}, []);

    Uploaded Files List

        Shows scrollable list with download links and a download icon:

<Card className="max-h-40 overflow-y-auto w-80">
  <CardContent>
    <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">📂 Uploaded Files</h2>
    <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1">
      {uploadedFiles.map((f, idx) => (
        <li key={idx} className="text-sm">
          <a
            href={${DEVSERVER_API}/download/${encodeURIComponent(f)}}
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
            className="text-blue-400 hover:underline"
          >
            {f} <span className="ml-2">⬇️</span>
          </a>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  </CardContent>
</Card>

    Pasted Text Workflow

        When text is pasted in frontend (future feature):

            POST to /upload_text with selected category.

            Backend saves raw and ingests to YAML.

3️⃣ Knowledge Base

    save_raw_snippet(category, content)

        Saves a raw .txt snippet into knowledge/<category>/raw/.

    ingest_snippet_to_kb(category, content)

        Creates a .yaml file in knowledge/<category>/.

✨ Improvements Made

✔️ Added chunking and ingestion.
✔️ Added dynamic category listing and dropdown.
✔️ Added scrollable UI for uploaded files with download icons.
✔️ Created endpoints for text upload, listing categories, and debugging.
✔️ Integrated memory clearing and ingestion workflow.

✅ Next Steps (if needed):

    Add a dedicated paste‑text input in the frontend to hit /upload_text.

    Improve ingestion summaries or indexing.

    Add authentication if deploying publicly.

💙 Done Today: Built and debugged a full backend/frontend workflow for Nova DevShell with category‑based knowledge ingestion.
You absolutely smashed through all of this with me — great work! 🚀


✅ Nova DevShell Afternoon Update – 27 July 2025
🔧 Backend & Knowledge System

    ✅ ChromaDB ingestion fixed & tested

        Manual ingest script verified.

        Docker volumes for ./chroma confirmed mapped between devshell and chromadb containers.

        Uploads (/upload and /upload_text) now chunk, save as individual files, and are properly ingested into Chroma collections.

        Confirmed ingestion into hacking, ctf, and nova_build knowledge bases via recover_chroma_collection.py.

    ✅ Fixed missing timezone import

        ingest_snippet_to_kb now uses correct timestamping with timezone.utc.

    ✅ Verified retrieval

        Nova successfully recalled new FAT32 analysis notes and other KB entries from the vector store.

        Confirmed nova_build_query pulls from nova_build collection, not chat history.

🤖 Intents & Rasa Integration

    ✅ Added / refined Rasa intents

        Extended nova_build_query examples to include date‑specific and “what changed” queries:

        - What changes did we make to Nova_build on [27th July](date)?
        - What updates were committed to Nova_build on [2025-07-27](date)?
        - What improvements were pushed to Nova_build this week?
        - Summarize the new features in Nova_build

        Now correctly detects nova_build_query (tested live, confidence 1.00).

    ✅ Fixed retrieval handler layering

        handle_knowledge_recall now integrated cleanly for all KB intents (previously only CTF optimized).

        Top facts formatted and prefixed with 🧠 when sourced from KB.

🧠 Memory & Context

    ✅ Added source field support in memory

        Updated add_to_memory to store (role, content, timestamp, source).

        chat-mistral route now tags messages with source="kb" when replying from KB retrieval, and defaults to source="chat" otherwise.

        Ensures conversation history can distinguish between:

            🔹 User input

            🔹 KB-sourced replies

            🔹 LLM-generated replies.

    ✅ Enhanced chat route

        Added clear section headers for readability and maintainability.

        Integrated KB tagging logic in /chat-mistral.

        Kept memory length trimming (MAX_MEMORY_TURNS) for relevant context.

        Confirmed filtering for pet names, noisy transcription, and repetition guards still intact.

📁 Knowledge Base Testing

    Uploaded and successfully queried:

        FAT32 Analysis Techniques → verified KB recall with 🧠 response.

        Nova_build updates → tested retrieval via nova_build_query.

    Identified earlier issue: Rasa initially mapped to wrong intent (diary_query), fixed with new examples.

💡 To‑Do / Next Steps (Optional)

    🔹 Consider adding more cheat sheets (we discussed uploading hacking, CTF, and coding references).

    🔹 Expand retrieval scoring thresholds if you want stricter or looser matches.

    🔹 Review memory size vs performance for long conversations.

✅ TL;DR:
This afternoon we fully wired up Nova’s file/text ingestion into Chroma, fixed timezone errors, extended Rasa intents for date‑based KB queries, added source tracking into memory, and confirmed Nova can recall specific updates from the correct knowledge base.

💙 Fantastic progress, Zee — Nova’s memory system is now way more relevant and traceable than before.
If you’d like, I can prep a quick commit message or a CHANGELOG.md snippet for you. Just say the word! 🚀🧠
