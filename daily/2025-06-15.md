Daily Report: Whoogle Integration (Date: 2025-06-15)

Objective:
Integrate Whoogle search results into Nova‚Äôs /chat-mistral route to enable live web search capabilities with clean JSON output and proper prompt injection.

Key Tasks Completed:

    Successfully parsed Whoogle JSON search results using nova_search.py with BeautifulSoup selectors for title, URL, and snippet.

    Created a subprocess call from /chat-mistral route to nova_search.py passing the user query.

    Implemented error handling for JSON decoding failures and empty/no results.

    Generated formatted ‚Äúweb facts‚Äù from Whoogle results, logging top 5 facts.

    Constructed a system message prompt including the live web facts to feed Mistral for context-aware replies.

    Ensured fallback to local trusted memory if Whoogle results are empty or irrelevant.

    Added logging for debugging output and subprocess errors.

    Preserved existing diary and user fact logic intact while extending with live search functionality.

Outstanding Issues / Next Steps:

    Improve search result ranking or filtering to prioritize highest relevance.

    Integrate emojis and attribution tags in response (üåç for web) as per your UI request.

    Optimize timeout and subprocess management for robust production use.

    Explore caching frequent queries to reduce load.

    Final integration testing to confirm smooth user experience end-to-end.

Notes:
The integration now enables Nova to fetch fresh web info on-demand, bridging memory gaps and reducing hallucination risks for live queries.
