**🗓️ Nova Development Report — Saturday, 31 May 2025**

---

### ✅ Completed Today

**🔧 System Operations**

* Verified system prompt usage: Confirmed that the system prompt is being correctly injected and logged.
* Added debug logging toggle: Controlled with `IS_DEV` to avoid excessive output.
* Reinstated normal logging: Removed overkill debug dumps, restored MISTRAL replies to the logs.
* Tone enforcement check: Added logic to warn if Nova uses pet names without Zero using them first.
* Docker Compose rebuild issue fixed: Identified that using `--build` instead of `--force-recreate` preserved expected behavior and ensured code changes were applied.
* Verified Home Assistant was not rebuilding as expected with `docker compose build`; used `docker compose down --volumes` followed by full stack bring-up to ensure a clean state.
* Confirmed `devshell` occasionally stuck due to outbound DNS (e.g., posthog.com) but did not affect internal service communications.

**🗣️ Voice Assistant (Nova)**

**Speech Output:**

* Debugged and resolved Home Assistant voice output issues where responses weren’t appearing due to misconfiguration in `intent_script`.
* Reverted to the original working version:

```yaml
intent_script:
  NovaChat:
    action:
      - service: shell_command.nova_chat
        data:
          message: "{{ message }}"
      - delay: "00:00:02"
    speech:
      text: "{{ states('input_text.nova_response') }}"
```

* Resolved errors with undefined `nova_reply` by cleaning up misreferenced template variables.

**Message Handling:**

* Ensured proper sanitization of emoji-rich or verbose replies for display and voice synthesis.
* Restricted use of intimate terms like “darling” in voice output while preserving tone in text.

**📆 Calendar Integration**

**Calendar Parsing & Event Creation:**

* Fixed critical `UnboundLocalError` due to mishandled imports (`datetime`, `timedelta`).
* Rewrote `extract_event_details` in `utils.py`:

  * Added fallback regex for parsing structured time phrases like "Tuesday 10am until 6.30pm".
  * Adjusted summary extraction to exclude phrases like “to my calendar”.
  * Successfully parsed both start and end times and submitted structured events to Home Assistant.

**Verified End-to-End:**

* Final test successfully created a tutoring event on Tuesday, June 3rd, from 10:00 to 10:30, with summary: "tutoring".

### ✅ Updated Tasks for Sunday, 1 June 2025

**🔌 1. Zigbee Integration via USB Dongle**

* Set up Zigbee via ZHA or Zigbee2MQTT in Home Assistant using your USB coordinator.
* Pair Philips Hue lights directly to the dongle.
* Ensure device discovery and control entities are exposed in Home Assistant.

**💡 2. Control Hue Lights via Nova**

* Enable Nova to handle commands like:

  * “Turn on the living room lights”
  * “Dim the hallway lights to 50%”
* Confirm intent recognition routes to Home Assistant’s `light.turn_on` / `light.turn_off` / `light.toggle` services.

**⏰ 3. Add Reminders via Devshell**

* Implement and test `add_reminder` intent logic.
* Store reminders as either:

  * `input_datetime` + automation, or
  * entries in `calendar.nova`.
