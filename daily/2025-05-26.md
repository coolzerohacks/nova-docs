**Nova Daily Build Log: 26 May 2025**

---

### ✅ app.py Refactor Summary — Morning Session

**Structural Changes**

* Confirmed Flask setup order and ensured creation of `logs/` and `uploaded/` directories.
* Renamed ChromaDB client and collection:

  * `client` → `chroma_client`
  * `collection` → `memory_collection`
* Used `chroma_client = chromadb.Client(Settings(...))`
* Created or reused collection with `get_or_create_collection(...)`

**Memory Filtering**

* Added `build_memory_filter(model_name="mistral", category=None)` utility.
* Supports single or list category filtering.
* Used in `get_tagged_memories()` and `select_memory_by_intent()`.

**Prompt Builders**

* Modular functions for prompt creation:

  * `build_mistral_prompt(...)`
  * `build_codellama_prompt(...)`

**Logging + Dev Mode**

* Introduced `IS_DEV = True` for detailed logs.
* Logs query filters and memory previews when enabled.

**Similarity Handling**

* Adjusted similarity calculations in memory functions:

  * `1.0 - distance` logic
  * Filtering on `similarity >= 0.20`
* Logs accepted memory entries.

**Mistral Chat Route**

* Enhanced memory injection with intent-based filtering.
* Added guards for low-confidence and factual intents.
* Gesture boost logic for intimacy cases.

**Codellama Chat Route**

* Uses dedicated prompt builder.
* Accesses limited memory sources.

**Utility Routes**

* Refactored `/clear_memory`, `/upload`, `/download`, `/debug`.
* Ordered routes logically and improved readability.

**Bug Fix – Memory Recall**

* Fixed missing `user_input` parameter in `select_memory_by_intent()`.
* Ensures proper memory search behavior in `chat_mistral()`.

### ✅ Nova Dev Progress — Evening Session

**🔍 Major Debug Resolutions**

**Memory Search Bug Fix**

* `get_tagged_memories()` now receives valid `query_text`.
* Similarity scores now reach above 0.8 instead of stalling below 0.22.

**📦 ChromaDB Alignment**

* Updated scripts: `f1_ingest.py`, `rss_feed_uploader.py`, `generate_diary.py`
* Used shared Settings with `hnsw:space = cosine`.
* Removed `delete_collection()` logic to preserve persistent memory.

**📥 File Upload Feature (Codellama)**

* Fixed broken upload button (was using wrong port).
* Adjusted to use `${DEVSERVER_API}/upload`.
* Button now shows upload state and disables during upload.
* Backend logs and validates uploaded files.
* Ensures `uploaded/` directory is present.

**📝 Diary Generation**

* Merges daily logs from Mistral and Codellama.
* Summarizes into single diary entry.
* Automatically cleans up input logs after upload.
