🛠️ Nova Development Report— 29 June 2025
🎯 Focus Areas Today

    Reduced Nova's message repetition

    Added general light control across rooms

    Fixed group light naming for Home Assistant

    Confirmed working live web search integration

🔁 Message Repetition Reduction
✅ Changes Implemented

    Added build_nova_redundancy_guard(memory) in message_guard.py:

        Detects repeated phrases in the last 4 Nova messages

        Blocks Nova from reusing or rephrasing them

    Updated build_mistral_prompt() to inject nova_redundancy_guard:

        Prevents repeated statements like "they're always competitive"

        Keeps dialogue moving forward

🔧 Prompt Construction Now Includes:

♻ Nova, you’ve said the following lines multiple times:
- “they're pretty competitive”
- “McLaren lets them race freely”
- “grab some snacks and watch together”

- Do NOT say these again or rephrase them.
- Provide new observations or move the conversation forward instead.

💡 Generalized Light Control
✅ Refactor Summary

    Created handle_light_control(user_input, action="turn_on") in intent_handlers.py

    Accepts any room from a predefined map:

ROOM_LIGHT_MAP = {
    "office": "light.office_light",
    "bedroom": "light.bedroom_light",  # corrected 'lights' → 'light'
    "kitchen": "light.kitchen_light"
}

Replaced handle_turn_on and handle_turn_off with:

    intent_handlers = {
        "turn_on": lambda input: handle_light_control(input, action="turn_on"),
        "turn_off": lambda input: handle_light_control(input, action="turn_off"),
        ...
    }

🧪 Confirmed Working

    Nova correctly turns on/off:

        office_light

        bedroom_light (via corrected entity name)

    Verified through logs and HA state tracking

🌍 Live Web Search
✅ Live Search Flow Operational

    Nova recognized live_web_search intent

    Fetched current F1 updates

    Referenced real-time snippets in response

    Prefixed responses with 🌍 for clarity

🧼 File Cleanup & Structure

    intent_handlers.py: now holds all handle_... logic

    ha_services.py: now limited to low-level service calls only
