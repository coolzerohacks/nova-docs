### 🗃️ Nova Voicebox Integration Status & Next Steps

**🔧 Current Setup**

**System:** Home Assistant + Nova (via Assist Chat and Devshell UI)

**Core Components:**

* Nova (LLM) available at: [http://devshell:5001/chat-mistral](http://devshell:5001/chat-mistral)
* Voicebox Device: ESPHome Voice Preview Edition (IP: 192.168.1.118)
* STT Engine: faster-whisper via Wyoming
* TTS Engine: wyoming-piper (media\_player entity)
* Shell Script: Posts message to Nova, writes to input\_text.nova\_response, logs to file
* Assist Intent Script: Triggers shell\_command.nova\_chat, renders input\_text.nova\_response
* ESPHome Config includes: i2s\_audio, speaker, mixer, resampler, media\_player
* Output verified working (physical playback confirmed)
* Devshell UI added to HA sidebar as web interface to talk directly to Nova

**🚀 Confirmed Working**

* Text chat flow from Assist to Nova and back
* Physical audio output from voicebox via media\_player.wyoming\_piper
* Nova's responses include context and character
* Devshell UI integrated as HA panel

**⌛ Known Limitations**

* Emoji (e.g. 🤗) may cause message parsing/rendering issues
* TTS queue may jam if response not handled properly
* Wake word detection still pending

**✅ Next Steps: Dual Voice Routing**

**Goal:** Allow Nova to process both smart home commands (via Assist) and rich conversational prompts (via Devshell UI) from the same voice input.

**Planned Actions:**

* Expose POST endpoint in nova-devshell-ui backend (e.g., /api/input)
* Detect intent failure/fallback in HA intent script or automation
* Forward fallback message to Nova devshell endpoint instead of processing as intent
* Distinguish sources in devshell UI with source: "assist" or source: "chat"
* Preserve Assist flows for control commands (e.g., "turn on the light")

**⚙ Optional Enhancements**

* Custom wake word model deployment (nova.onnx)
* OTA updates for voicebox
* Live logs endpoint from ESPHome
* Automatic emoji filtering for TTS safety

🗂️ Git & Container Management Notes

📁 Git Hygiene

Git was rejecting pushes due to large model files (e.g., .onnx, Whisper cache).

Adjusted .gitignore to exclude:

piper-data/

faster-whisper-config/

home-assistant-voice-pe/

Used git rm --cached where necessary to clean tracked files without deleting locally.

Force push (--force) used after clearing large files to sync correctly with GitHub.

📦 Container Structure

New container home-assistant-voice-pe (ESPHome-based) added but excluded from Git to avoid embedding another repo.

Future containers should:

Be listed in .gitignore if they contain large binaries or are separate projects.

Avoid embedded .git directories unless purposefully managed as submodules.

Store models/data in .cache/, models/, or similar and exclude from Git by default.
