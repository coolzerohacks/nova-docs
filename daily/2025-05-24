## Daily Summary: Nova Dev Progress â€“ 2025-05-24

Today was a huge milestone in Nova's evolution. Here's what we achieved:

### ðŸ§  Memory and Embeddings

* Switched ChromaDB from default L2 to cosine similarity for better vector matching.
* Updated `app.py`, F1 ingest, and diary generator to use consistent Chroma setup with `hnsw:space` metadata.
* Resolved confusion around similarity scores: clarified that lower distances mean higher similarity.

### ðŸ¤– Nova Mistral Core

* Verified that Nova Mistral now selects relevant memories and avoids hallucination.
* Adjusted thresholds and fallback logic for memory injection based on intent confidence.
* Ensured intimacy and factual intent handling behave consistently.

### ðŸ’¬ CodeLlama Coding Brain

* Reconfirmed the simplified route structure in `chat_codellama`.
* Isolated its system prompt into `system_codellama.py` to keep logic clean.
* Validated F1 memory match via CTF example; scored responses are sensible and filtered well.

### ðŸ§µ Discord Integration

* Removed legacy `nova-brain`, rewired Discord bot to point to CodeLlama chat endpoint.
* Converted blocking `requests` calls to `aiohttp` async for better Discord runtime.
* Fixed critical bugs with indentation and response parsing.
* Verified bot behavior: messages flow from DM -> memory -> devshell -> reply.

### ðŸ§¹ Cleanup & Git

* Removed orphan containers and deleted \~337GB of old Docker images.
* Restructured repo: added `nova-docs` branch, pushed full sync to main.
* Set up daily cron job plan for auto-tagging and version sync.

### ðŸ”§ Next Steps

* Tune CodeLlama system prompt tone further.
* Expand Discord bot with `/status`, `/help`, and memory feedback tools.
* Begin work on file summarizer -> vector memory ingestion pipeline.
