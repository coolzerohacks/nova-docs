✅ Completed Tasks
1. Greeting & Repetition Fixes

    Suppressed repeated greetings within a 5–10 minute session window.

    Added memory checks to avoid repeating user questions.

    Reduced opening verbosity unless conversation is reinitiated after idle time.

2. News Summarization Improvements

    Pulled and filtered top 3–4 distinct headlines using vector memory.

    Included source labels and adjusted formatting for clarity.

    Allowed low-similarity headlines when no stronger matches exist.

3. Memory + Knowledgebase Integration

    Unified memory lookup and KB document retrieval under select_memory_by_intent().

    Introduced dual-threshold logic:

        📂 Memory if sim ≥ 0.6

        🔎 Possible match if 0.4 ≤ sim < 0.6

    Added hallucination guard trigger when no relevant memory or KB found.

    Logged ChromaDB filters, similarities, and responses for debugging.

4. Prompt Construction Overhaul

    Improved prompt formatting with:

        Trusted facts

        Output repeat and hallucination guards

        Time/date injection

        Tone guard (e.g., disallow uninvited pet names)

    Enabled consistent and traceable system messages.

5. Intent-Aware Soft Context

    Ensured Nova maintains topic coherence even with borderline matches.

    Prevented shifting focus away from intent-aligned topics.

⚠️ In Progress
6. Embedding Dimension Mismatch

    Confirmed correct model: multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 (768 dim) used for both upload and query.

    Likely mismatch source:

        Legacy 384-dim vectors in ChromaDB.

        Old uploads without enforced embedding dimensions.

    Planning cleanup or reindexing to avoid future misalignments.

🕒 Upcoming Tasks
7. Timezone and UTC Handling

    Replace all datetime.utcnow() with datetime.now(timezone.utc) in all scripts.

    Update Nova’s time output to reflect BST (British Summer Time).

    Evaluate use of zoneinfo or pytz for full daylight saving support
