Nova — End of Day Report (2025-06-26)
Major Event

    Full rebuild:
    Nova was completely rebuilt from the recovered devshell files after earlier issues.
    All services—including Rasa, UI, and supporting containers—were redeployed and reconfigured from scratch.

Fixes Completed
Rasa Permissions (Permanent Fix)

    All code and git files in /home/coolzerohacks/nova-setup/rasa are now owned by the main user (coolzerohacks).

    For permanent, hassle-free writes by both the host and container,
    the following was applied to Rasa’s writable folders:

    chmod -R a+rwX /home/coolzerohacks/nova-setup/rasa/models
    chmod -R a+rwX /home/coolzerohacks/nova-setup/rasa/.rasa

    This ensures both the main user and any container user (e.g., UID 1001, or root) can always read/write/update models and cache.

    No further permission adjustments will be needed after this setup, even after retrains or code pushes.

Knowledge Base Issue

    Rasa’s old models, caches, and volumes were deleted.

    Rasa was retrained using up-to-date data to clear out intent and cache errors.

Logging

    Reply logging is now consistent, including for knowledge base replies, by adding a log before every reply return.

Outstanding / To-Do

    Set up cron jobs.

    Web search:
    live_web_search intent handler is not working—needs troubleshooting.
