## Nova Daily Build Log: 25 May 2025

### üåü Major Wins Today

#### Codellama + Mistral Unified Logging

* Refactored `chat_memory.py` to accept `model_name` and save daily conversations in a shared long-form log per model.
* Removed duplicate memory logic from `memory_codellama.py`, replaced with `chat_memory` usage.
* Confirmed consistent logging for Mistral; Codellama is writing to file now but needs memory retrieval checks.

#### System Prompt Refactor

* Created `prompts.py` and moved `SYSTEM_PROMPT_MISTRAL` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT_CODELLAMA` into it.
* Updated `app.py` to import from `prompts.py`, reducing clutter.

#### Improved Chat Logging

* Unified logging to prevent scattered `.txt` logs.
* Diary system now pulls from unified logs.

#### Container Cleanup and Rebuild

* Removed over 300 GB of untagged Docker images.
* Rebuilt and confirmed images for `devshell`, `nova-discord`, and `template-router`.
* Verified `devshell` is bound to port 5001 and routing properly.

#### Structured Logging Integration

* Replaced `print` statements with Python's `logging` module in `bot.py`.
* Set up `logs/nova.log` to track Nova‚Äôs runtime events and errors.

#### Daily Image and Volume Audit

* Verified all Docker volumes and images.
* Ran `docker image prune` to clear old layers.
* Confirmed no rogue image bloat from Git or container rebuilds.

#### Nova-Discord Service Debugging

* Fixed routing issue by correcting the `devshell` port to 5001.
* Investigated and resolved `ConnectionRefused` errors.

#### Live Bot Logging

* Added runtime logging into `bot.py` for all Discord messages and Codellama interactions.
* Confirmed file-based logging and fallback error messages are operational.

#### Git Repo Maintenance

* Audited `.gitignore` for large binary and Docker artifacts.
* Ensured no heavy image files or cache were reintroduced post-clean.
* Validated working directory remains clean after builds.
* Confirmed all relevant changes are tracked and committed.

### üí° Insights + Notes

* Codellama retrieved memories today, but most were F1 related and not clearly relevant. Might need tighter filtering.
* Still some duplication in memory logic between Mistral and Codellama flow.
* Logging now captures user interactions, API errors, and memory write events.
* Docker containers and images now fully lean ‚Äî Nova's stack is clean and fast.
* Git is behaving ‚Äî no signs of large files creeping back into the repo.

### ‚úçÔ∏è TODO Tomorrow

(Write this section next.)

### üìÉ Current Codebase Highlights

* `chat_memory.py`: handles persistent memory + per-model chat logs.
* `prompts.py`: holds system-level instructions for Mistral and Codellama.
* `app.py`: main Flask logic, uses shared memory and embedded vector search.
* `nova-discord`: connects Discord to Nova via devshell route.
* `bot.py`: now logs all user interaction, commands, and Codellama responses.
