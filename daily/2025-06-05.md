🛠️ Nova Development Summary – June 5th, 2025
🧠 Intent Expansion and Tuning

    Finalized and refined Rasa intents:

        hacking_knowledge_request

        ctf_walkthrough_request

        ctf_tips

        coding_help

        nova_internal_architecture

    Reworked training examples to sound natural and conversational (e.g., "Hey Nova, can you walk me through buffer overflows?").

    Added all new intents to domain.yml and ensured they are used in stories or via custom intent handling logic.

📚 Knowledge Memory Improvements

    Injected support in chat_mistral for:

        Routing hacking_knowledge_request, coding_help, and ctf_walkthrough_request to ChromaDB collections: hacking_knowledge, coding_knowledge, and ctf.

    Adjusted logic to only use these memory collections if confidence ≥ 0.6.

    Set up memory uploads using YAML files via nightly cron jobs for each category.

🤖 GPT Assistants for YAML Generation

Created 4 specialized ChatGPTs to assist in generating YAML uploads:

    Coding Knowledge GPT

    Hacking Knowledge GPT

    CTF Walkthrough GPT

    Nova Build Summary GPT

Each one is designed with custom prompts and output formats to match Nova’s ingestion pipeline.
📦 CTF Format Support

    Defined YAML template for CTF challenges using starter, challenges, and walkthrough structure.

    Verified example for "Steel Mountain" is parsed correctly, including Metasploit usage, privilege escalation, and enumeration steps.

✅ Internal Build Memory Integration

    Created new intent: nova_internal_architecture

    Added new collection: nova_build

    Enabled chat_mistral to handle build-related queries by injecting nova_build memories.

    Example supported queries:

        “Nova, what did we change in app.py yesterday?”

        “When did we last train Rasa?”

🛡️ Tone Guard Improvements

    Replaced full message suppression for uninvited pet names.

    Now sanitizes response by replacing terms like “my love” with “Zee”.

    Preserves rest of response naturally to avoid disruption in flow.
