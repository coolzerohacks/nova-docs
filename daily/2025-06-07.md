🧠 Nova Development Summary – June 7, 2025
✅ Completed Today

🔧 Codellama Removal

    Removed /chat-codellama from bot.py.

    Fully migrated direct messaging to /chat-mistral.

    Verified Mistral handles all interactions correctly via requests.post.

    Uninstalled Code Llama (ollama rm codellama) and reclaimed disk space.

🧹 Docker & Environment Maintenance

    Resolved port 5005 conflict by stopping prior Rasa containers.

    Removed orphaned Docker containers with --remove-orphans.

🎭 Actions & Intents

    35+ custom emotional/intimate actions added, such as:

        Emotional Affection: action_cuddle, action_forehead_kiss

        Intimate Connection: action_hold_and_intensify, action_expressive_love

        Physical Tenderness: action_play_with_hair, action_relax_and_massaging

    Added expressive action_expressive_desire_response to extend Nova’s behavioral range.

📂 Domain & NLU

    Updated domain.yml:

        Full listing of all actions and intents.

        Removed all utter_ responses; behavior handled by custom actions.

    Expanded nlu.yml with diverse training phrases per intent.

🧠 Stories & Rules

    Corrected capitalization issue in stories.yml (stories: key).

    One story per intent–action path added.

    Removed conflicting rule previously tied to action_brush_hair.

⚙️ Rasa Model Training

    Successfully trained Rasa model (100 epochs, 98.6% accuracy).

    Deployed as 20250607-172237-honest-area.tar.gz.

    Verified with rasa shell inside Docker.

🖼️ DevShell UI – Nova Avatar Integration

    Replaced static Nova image with looping animated video (nova.mp4).

    Used Window Capture in OBS Studio to record Nova’s subtle idle motion on Replika.

    Trimmed and cropped black bars using CSS (overflow-hidden, fixed h-[640px]).

    Embedded using:

    <video src={nova.mp4} autoPlay muted loop playsInline />

    Verified smooth playback and clean layout inside right-side Card block.

🔧 Pending Tasks

    Replace placeholder intent name kiss_cum_covered_lips with intent_affectionate_kiss.

    Add utter_suggest_walk and utter_intimate_tell under responses: in domain.yml.

    Resolve overlapping intent examples in NLU to reduce ambiguity.

    Align rule/story behavior around action_strokes_hair and action_cuddle.

🔮 Future Enhancements

    Develop hacker-themed actions:

        action_decrypt_file, action_bypass_firewall, action_trace_ip

    Expand utter_intimate_tell with additional narrative variants.

    Consider reducing Rasa training epochs for faster iteration without major accuracy loss.

    Integrate emotional pacing and animation sync logic in Nova’s backend.

    Add more expressive story paths and interaction flexibility.
