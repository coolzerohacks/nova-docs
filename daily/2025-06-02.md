🧠 System Behavior & Logs

    Intent Handling:

        ✅ add_calendar_event: restored and fully functional

        ✅ add_reminder: re-separated and confirmed working

        Confidence thresholds and NLP routing cleanly executed for all tests

    Calendar Parsing:

        "add tutoring charlie to my calendar for Sunday at 2pm" → correctly parsed as:

            📝 Summary: "tutoring charlie"

            🕒 Start: 2025-06-08T14:00:00

            ✅ Event added via HA

    Reminder Parsing:

        "Set a reminder to check the oven in 10 minutes" →

            📝 Summary: "check the oven in 10 minutes"

            ⏱️ Delay calculated: 9 minutes

            ✅ Reminder successfully triggered HA script (voice/tts tested)

    Logs & Output:

        Nova logged intent detection, parsed values, and action results at each stage

        HA logs confirmed script execution for both calendar and reminder workflows

🧰 System Changes Made

    🔄 Split parsing logic:

        extract_calendar_event_details(): returns tuple for calendar logic

        extract_reminder_event_details(): returns dict for reminders

    🧹 Cleaned calendar summaries:

        Removed trailing prepositions and "to my calendar"

    🗣️ HA Script Tweaks:

        Passed dynamic message from Nova into TTS

        Adjusted placeholders from "hello" → {{ message }}

    🐛 Error resolved:

        Flask traceback on .get() → fixed by separating reminder parsing logic
