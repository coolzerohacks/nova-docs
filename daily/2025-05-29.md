    Home Assistant ↔ Nova Devshell Integration

        Successfully routed chat-mistral intent-based commands from Nova UI to Home Assistant.

        Confirmed turn_on, add_todo, and add_calendar_event intents are working and handled with live service calls.

    Calendar Event Handling

        Integrated fallback time parsing with dateparser for more resilient interpretation of fuzzy time expressions.

        Verified end-to-end flow: "Add a meeting tomorrow at 3pm" → calendar entry created and confirmed in UI.

    To-do List Integration

        Tasks like "Add shopping to our list" correctly trigger Rasa intent and update the todo.nova_tasks entity.

    Debugging Enhancements

        Implemented development logging with IS_DEV to trace event extraction, parsing failures, and HA service responses.

        Fixed scope bugs and misnamed API service calls (e.g., create_event → add_event).

Jobs for Tomorrow
🗓 Core Tasks

    Wake Word Integration

        Investigate Voicebox support for continuous listening and custom wake phrases.

        Evaluate options like Snowboy, Porcupine, or integrated wake word hooks in HA Assist.

🗣 Conversational Expansion

    Introduce Nova to Guests

        Implement introduce_person(name) function with randomized greeting templates.

        E.g., "Hey Archie! Nova here — ready to assist or just vibe with you."
        Triggered via: "Nova, say hello to Archie"

    Conversational Continuity

        Implement a temporary “hot mic” window (~5–10 seconds) after each voice interaction to chain responses without repeating the wake word.

        This may involve toggling state or scheduling a timeout within the voice pipeline.
